REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL
FOR
AUSSIE BUSINESS BUZZ (ABB)

BACKGROUND
Aussie Business Buzz (ABB) is a leading technology retail and service provider, offering a diverse range of products such as PCs, laptops, phones, routers, and device repair services along with mobile accessories. Operating across four branches, ABB seeks to implement an integrated system to streamline operations and enable smooth scalability for future growth.

BASIC SUMMARY
Aussie Business Buzz (ABB) is working on a project that will enable it to unify operations throughout its expanding retail network into a single system. This all-inclusive system will manage stock management, customer interactions, digital marketing, and reporting with the goal of consolidating scattered information that is currently dispersed throughout its four branch stores. The present architecture of ABB collects important customer and maintenance data, but it has problems with disjointed systems and lacks the smooth integration required for effective operations throughout locations. Using modern technology stacks, the suggested approach aims to achieve seamless data synchronisation, facilitating focused marketing campaigns, effective inventory control, and insightful analytics for tactical decision-making. Prospective suppliers will have to handle the intricacies of data migration, guarantee flawless integration, and navigate legacy systems. The initial objectives will be to improve inventory management, streamline marketing automation, and merge customer data. However, the complex process of data conversion and compatibility issues with existing systems may pose challenges.
